could have made mapping between the cells displayed on the page and the gameboard easier. Instead I had to find the formula const square = cpuCells[+y * 10 + +x], which works but seems a little clunky

learnt about the importance of splitting up code - one job per thing

0,0 = 0
1,1 = 12
5,4 =


((y + 1) * 9) + (x-1)
